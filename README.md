## Quick start
Below is described how to get the **Ethereum Studio** project setup and running locally.

### Install node modules
```sh
npx lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

### Run in development mode
```sh
npm start
```

Browse to `http://localhost:3000`. Note that if you use any other hostname/IP than `localhost`, then instead run update 'ORIGIN' value in 'env.development', this is important so that the iframes can communicate with the main window.

### Make a production build
```sh
npm run build
```

The dist files will be inside `./dist`. Note that the this command uses production version of ".env" file, so in order to test it locally please create a ".env.local" with proper ORIGIN variable value prior to build.

### Bumping version
Set the new version both in `app.js` and in `manifest.json`.

Run this script to fix that for you:

```sh
./bump_version "1.1.0"
```

Consider double-checking and updating the `CHANGELOG` to reflect the changes. Tag the new version.

### Modifying templates
Templates are now located inside `./packages/editor/templates` folder. After you modify those files and want to see changes you need to run `generate-templates.js` script inside `./packages/editor/scripts`.
